# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

# Dependabot processes patterns in groups sequentially, assigning dependencies to the first matching group and excluding them from subsequent groups. 
# The wildcard group will capture dependencies that haven't matched any of the previous groups, ensuring no duplicates while acting as a fallback for unclassified updates.
